## Why row-based?
1. The row-based approach is chosen because it is the most common way to store images in memory. This way, we can easily load images from disk and store them in memory without having to reshape them. 
1. We are working on a University HPC Project, for an exam, a deeper ablation study would be useful if this was used in a real-world scenario. But as we are focusing on the HPC part, we are not going to do that.
